# Sania Nadeems art gallery website

## What is the purpose of this project?

The purpose of this project is for me to create a font end mobile-first responseive website for users to see the clients work. Anyone that is 
interesed in the clients work will be able to look at lots of different images of the client. They will also be able to do things such as get in
touch with the client and get to know a little about her. 

## Functionality of the project.

This website is fully responseive for all sorts of devices ranging from desktops to small mobile phones. One of the ways this has been done 
is by collapsing the navigation bar into a hamburger menu on mobile devices.
