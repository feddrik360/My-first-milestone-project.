# Sania Nadeems art gallery website

## What is the purpose of this project?

The purpose of this project is for me to create a font end mobile-first responsive website for users to see the clients work. Anyone that 
is interesed in the clients work will be able to look at lots of different images of the client. They will also be able to do things 
such as get in touch with the client and get to know about her. 

## UDX

The UDX of this website is on my Github page.

## Features of the website

Works page - Allows users visiting the site to click on any of the images and view them in a slideshow. The slideshow goes through 
Images automatically as well. 

Social media links on the footer - This will be very beneficial for users to be able to view my clients social media platform in a new tab.

Works page gallery - Users will be able to see the clients work in a slideshow on any screen size. They will also be able to swipe left
or right if they want to go through the slideshow.

## Potential features in the future

Make the contact page more functional by having the information submitted by users to actually be stored somewhere. This is something
that I will learn later on this course.

## Functionality of the project

This website is fully responseive for devices ranging from desktops to small mobile phones. One of the ways this has been done 
is by collapsing the navigation bar into a hamburger menu on mobile devices. The works page has lots of images that are
viewable in a slideshow. To come out of the slideshow, either the close button or the cross needs to be clicked on. Unfortunately
the contact form is not very functional as when the form gets filled out, the information does not go anywhere.

## Technologies used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Cloud 9 IDEA
- GIT
- GITHUB
- Google Chrome developer tools
- Bootstrap
- Javascript and JQuery

## Deployment

I coded the website on an IDE called Cloud 9. Once it was on there, I uploaded the website on to GITHUB. I would open a new terminal and
enter in the following:

- 1.)git init (This was to create the repository)
- 2.)git add [file name]
- 3.)git commit -m "first commit"
- 4.)git remote add origin [site link]
- 5.)git push -u origin master

## Testing

Throughout the whole project, I made sure to test the website on all a variety of devices via the Chrome Developer Tools.
These Devices included:

- Galaxy S5
- Iphone 5/SE
- Iphone 6/7/8
- Iphone 6/7/8 plus
- Iphone X
- Ipad 
- Ipad Pro

Examples of testing that I have done :

- I have clicked on every single image on the gallery page to make sure the right image loads up.
- I have clicked on all the links on the navigation bar on each page to make sure they all work.
- I pressed the "SEND" button on the contacts page, to check that when nothing is filled out an error message will come up.
- I have filled out the whole form without an '@' sign in the email box, and it does advise an '@' sign is required.


I have also made sure that the website looks aesthetically pleasing on all different size. Furthermore, I have made sure to actually
try the website on my Mobile phone and also on different browsers such as Firefox and Safari.

## Credits

All artwork was created by the client, who is currently studying Fine Art at university. I was asked by the client to create this
website as part of her university project.
